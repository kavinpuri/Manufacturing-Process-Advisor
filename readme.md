# Manufacturing-Process-Advisor
Automated the manufacturing process selection for a given sheet metal part using machine learning algorithms

**Problem Statement**
To predict the most suitable manufacturing process, either stamping, casting, or welding, for a given metal part.

**Scope:**
Currently the decision-making process is based on expert knowledge and experience, which can be subjective and time-consuming.
The successful implementation of this project will provide manufacturers, engineers, and designers with a data-driven decision-making tool to swiftly determine the most suitable manufacturing process for a given metal part.

**Pros and Cons of manufacturing processes**

**Stamping**

_Pros_

1. Faster manufacturing process.
2. Complex shapes may have higher strength.

_Cons_

1. Tooling investment is high
2. Metal thickness and low annual volume production limitation

**Welding**

_Pros_

1. No tooling cost involved
2. Metal of any size and thickness can be weld

_Cons_

1. Time consuming & less scope of automation
2. Cost increases with increase in weld length

**Casting**

_Pros_

1. Handle complex shapes without any limitations
2. Size and weight of metal part has no limitations

_Cons_

1. Not economical for mass production
2. Poor dimensional consistency and accuracy
