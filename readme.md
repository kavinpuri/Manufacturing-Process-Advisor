# Manufacturing-Process-Advisor
Automated the manufacturing process selection for a given sheet metal part using machine learning algorithms

**Problem Statement**
To predict the most suitable manufacturing process, either stamping, casting, or welding, for a given metal part.

**Scope:**
Currently the decision-making process is based on expert knowledge and experience, which can be subjective and time-consuming.
The successful implementation of this project will provide manufacturers, engineers, and designers with a data-driven decision-making tool to swiftly determine the most suitable manufacturing process for a given metal part.

**Pros and Cons of manufacturing processes**

**Stamping**

_Pros_

1. Faster manufacturing process.
2. Complex shapes may have higher strength.

_Cons_

1. Tooling investment is high
2. Metal thickness and low annual volume production limitation

**Welding**

_Pros_

1. No tooling cost involved
2. Metal of any size and thickness can be weld

_Cons_

1. Time consuming & less scope of automation
2. Cost increases with increase in weld length

**Casting**

_Pros_

1. Handle complex shapes without any limitations
2. Size and weight of metal part has no limitations

_Cons_

1. Not economical for mass production
2. Poor dimensional consistency and accuracy

**Future use of the model and Scaling up opportunities**

1. Increasing the training dataset and adding one more parameters like Complexity of part will provide more better predictions on parts with less annual volume.
2. Hosting and distributing among all the teams for usage.
3. GUI can be smooth and more user friendly. Just by entering part number, we can extract all parameters at backend and predict its manufacturing process and also predict the scope of converting its manufacturing process.

**Business usage, impact, and benefits**

- Can be very effective for any product line focusing on cost reduction ideation or evaluation 
- Provide faster decision making by narrowing scope of opportunity for process conversion
- Encourage design engineers to evaluate and explore current manufacturing processes for CR opportunities
- Can be enhanced for outlier detection program for $/kg
